            Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
            Design simple views for each state in your application, and React
            will efficiently update and render just the right components when
            your data changes. Declarative views make your code more
            predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
            Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their
            state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic
            is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass
            rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM. Learn
            Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of
            your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React
            without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server
            using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
